            When clicking the plugin icon a popup window appears. The popup window is seperated in three subsection. The 1) pie chart scetion, the 2) statistics and the 3) options section. <br />
        1) The pie chart displays the statistics about the number of advertisements caught during the lifetime of the plugin in a user friendly fashion. Advertisements are divided in two categories: the encrypted and the plaintext. Encrypted are the ads that their value is in encrypted format, and plaitext is the ads that their value is unencrypted. 
        <br />
        2) The statistics session displays the statistics about the ads. This section is divided in two subsections as well 'all time stats' and 'current session stats'.
        In the 'all time stats' sections statistics about advertisements through all the lifetime of the plugin are displayed. This statistics include the number of encrypted advertisements, the number of the cleartext advertisements and the total value of the advertisements you have seen in USD.
        In the 'current session stats' are displayed the same statistics but only for the period you open your browser until you close it again.
        <br />
        3) In the options section you are given the choice to disable the plugin and to see the description page(this page). If you disable the plugin your choice is valid only until you close your browser.
